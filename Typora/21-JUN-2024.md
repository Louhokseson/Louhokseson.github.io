# Fit the Hokseon Model with Optimization.jl



On Friday June 14, Hokseon had a meeting with Reini about Hokseon's fitted model. Reini suggested hokseon using Optimization.jl to make the model's calculated charges and Eigen-composited NAH with the given DFT PES and Mulliken charges from Nils.

## General Thoughts

### Build the Loss function

- The DFT Part

In discrete form:
$$
L_{\text{DFT}} = \sum_i||EV(x_i) - \text{DFT}(x_i)||^2
$$
