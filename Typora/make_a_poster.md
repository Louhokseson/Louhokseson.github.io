**Obvious Flow**

- Column structure easy to follow

**Less Words**

- Based on graphs and figures
- A little bit texts explaining graphs
- Go back and remove words (Don't cram words)

**Direction Information**

- Read the title and understand the conclusion quickly
- No fancy words in title?? Keep it simple (Not sure about this bullet point)

**Colours**

- Keep in 3 colours
- [Coolors](https://coolors.co) generates the colour codes 
- Try not to use the University template
