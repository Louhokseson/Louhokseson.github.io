### *GW* and QS*GW*

What is screening?

**My thoughts:** 

GW starts with a non-interacting Green function(hybridisation function) do iterations/ perturbation steps.

*GW* comes from Hedin's Equation?

Steps

- polarisability
- And so on

More papers about GW you can find [here](https://www.questaal.org/tutorial/gw/qsgw_si/#footnotes-and-references) [1-5].
