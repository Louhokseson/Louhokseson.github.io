# Theoretical Physics Group Seminar 24 May

Spin dynamics in radical pairs

Speaker: Prof. David Manolopoulos (Oxford Chemistry)

Theoretical Physics Group Seminar

Trace Sampling: It was mentioned in this [paper](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article/154/8/084121/76322/Spin-relaxation-in-radical-pairs-from-the).



The trace sampling might link to the electronic relaxation which could link to the friction evaluation (Especially the memory friction)
