### [$3^{\text{rd}}$​ May 2024](3-MAY-2024.html)

Pointed out the $h(x)$​ will become a part of valence band when adsorbate is far from the surface under current ErpenbeckThoss model.

### [$10^{\text{th}}$ May 2024](10-MAY-2024.html)

Corrected the understanding of configuration vector and $h(x)$ would move along the valence band and conduction band when we vary the distance. Shifted the band above and obtained a "prefect" gapped adiabatic PESs. Raised a question on link between broadening effect of states and the unique adiabatic eigenvalues computed from Hamiltonian Matrix. 

### [$17^{\text{th}}$ May 2024](17-MAY-2024.html)

Made an animation of projected DOS. Had a discussion on the mathematical details on the projection.
