# Gapped Trapezoidal Rule

Hokseon implemented a `GapTrapezoidalRule` in [here](https://github.com/maurergroup/NQCModels.jl/tree/hokseson). 

The bath's DOS with 3eV bandgap is

The red dots are the discretized states of the bath. Obviously, when bandgap equal to zero, there are two states with value of the centre in our `GapTrapezoidalRule`. So, to make my function general, I let it directly do the `TrapezoidalRule` when bandgap = 0 eV instead.



# Rescaling Projected DOS

The main goal of the projected DOS is to find the how much contribution from the each eigenstates in the total system (bath + impurity) to the impurity's DOS. These weights can be calculated by projecting the eigenvectors matrix onto the absorbate basis
$$
[1,0,0,0,\cdots,0]^T
$$

More speifically, we should have
$$
\langle\phi_{\text{projected}}| H_{\text{el}}(x) = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1\\
0\\
0\\
\vdots\\
0
\end{bmatrix}^T
\cdot
\begin{bmatrix}
\textcolor{red}{h} & \textcolor{red}{A_{1}} & \textcolor{red}{A_{2}} & \cdots & \textcolor{red}{A_{n}} \\
A_{1} & \epsilon_1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
A_{2} & 0 & \epsilon_2 & \cdots & 0 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
A_{n} & 0 & 0 & \cdots & \epsilon_n \\
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
h\\
A_1\\
A_2\\
\vdots\\
A_n
\end{bmatrix}^T.
$$
By doing this step, we could compute the contribution from each eigenstates to the impurity states
$$
|\langle\phi_{\text{projected}}| \cdot [|\phi_{1}\rangle,|\phi_{2}\rangle,\cdots,|\phi_{n}\rangle]|^2 = [a_1^2,a_2^2,\cdots,a_n^2].
$$
The raw projected denisty of states is given as 

![PDOS_non-scaled](fig/24-May-2024/PDOS_non-scaled.png)

with area $\approx 740$. This number seem to be $\textcolor{red}{\text{robust}}$​​ even when I change the nstates, width of the band and standard deviation of Gaussian distributions. Just curious about this weird number.  

We plot this weights `ustrip(auconvert.(u"eV", evecs[200][1,:])).^2` against the eigenvalues:

![weigths_vs_Eigenenergy](fig/24-May-2024/weigths_vs_Eigenenergy.png)

The abnormal outliner represents the projected impurity's location in energy space. However, the scale of it is a bit way to big comparing with the rest of the weights.

```julia
julia> maximum(ustrip(auconvert.(u"eV", evecs[200][1,:])).^2)
721.4766814562648
```

Any ideas on this?

By dividing the area of the DOS, we easily obtain a more sensible PDOS.

# DFT Ground State PES

Given data from Nils, we have

# Hokseon Concerns

### Actual Usage of `bathcoupling` in Wideband Assumption



Isn't it to make the DOS flat? Then, why do we have bathcoupling for Trapezoidal rule?



# After Meeting, Hokseon to-do-list

- Plot the DFT PES onto the adiabtic PES
- Integration up to Fermi level for Projected DOS not sure the meaning of it but what's Reini said tho.
