# Hydrogen with A Electron Already 

This note is to record the ideas after the regular Friday meeting with Reini on $3^{\text{rd}}$ May 2024. [Xuexun](https://louhokseson.github.io) remains all the copyright© of this script.

In the previous [note](3-MAY-2024.html), we have discussed that how adiabatic PES are calculated and raise a question at the end why does the eigenvalue of absorbate occur under the Fermi energy? **It turns out that those accumulation states where charged impurity state $h(x)$​ becomes a part of the valence band.**

To address the "黐線 ci-sin" phenomenon at the tail of the adiabatic PES plot, where the absorbate state is situated in the valence band, we opt to artificially introduce a pre-existing electron to hydrogen.

In this scenario, our attention shifts to the tail region characterized by a small coupling effect, signifying that $h(x)$​​ is the eigenstate of the absorbate. By setting the ground state occpuational vector as
$$
\begin{align}
|1,\cdots, 1 ,1 ,1,\textcolor{red}{1},0,0,0\cdots,0 \rangle \tag{Ground}
\end{align}
$$
where the impurity state is occupied as the highlighted as 1. Giving a extra electron in the system is equivalent of eliminating those accumulation states I mentioned in last note
