            <h2> What is this about?</h2>
            <p>In contrast to the conventional chemistry in labs, my project is <b>a fully programming-based and computational theories demanding</b> research. It actually has more <b>physics, mathematics and CS</b> than chemistry.
            </p>
            <p>
               Imagine we fire a particle onto a surface, this particle will interact with the surface atoms and change the electronic configuration of the whole system. This type of configurational perturbation kicks in by energy transfering from the particle to the surface (i.e. the virbational energy of particle).
               This amount of energy causes some of the electrons hop onto higher energy states which is so called <i>electronic excitiation</i>. In some cases,  partcle might bounce back after the collision eventually where it is how scienists define it as <i>scattering</i>.
               There can be an another case called <i>desorption</i> where the particle is absorbed by the surface where its chemical bonds might be broken as a result of the collision. In this way, we fundamentally explain why some metal calayst could <b>accelerate the chemical reactions</b>. 
               A better theroetical understanding of these processes can help us to design <b>more efficient medium for releasing or storing energy such as battery, fuel cell, etc. </b> What's more, if we replaced the metal with <b>seminconductor</b> and particle with photon, our knowledge would be applied into advancing the 
               <b>photolithography</b> on the seminconductor surface where helps those integrated circuit factories like TSMC, Qualcomm and Intel to produce smaller and faster chips.
            </p>
            <p>
                Instead of spending time and money on the experiments, a rigorous and easy-to-use  <b>computable model</b>  will accelerate the designs and testings of those material and particle. This is where my project and most of the projects in my group come in.

            <h2>Why am I doing this?</h2>
            <p>First things first, this project was proposed by my supervisor, an ambitious surface scienist, leading the surfaces science field. He has introduced the <i>ab initio</i> </p>
